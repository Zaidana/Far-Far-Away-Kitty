# Far-Far-Away-Kitty
This is an infinite runner type of game where the main objective is to get the higher amount of points and keep running for the most amount of time, by avoiding obstacles, enemies and collecting cans of tuna that increase your score. 

## Creation of the game
It was a complicated game, first we had to determine the elements needed, player, enemies, obstacles and collectables, and after that it was an effort on trying to add colliders, events and riggid bodies so all the elments could coexist withing the virtual raim. One of the hardest things was to develop the movement when the player hit the obstacle and start going off screen, since for some reason the player always teletransport to the other side of the obstacle when you move it right. 

It was funny and hard, a really good experience since it helped me understanding in a deeper way all the concepts and elements to create a videogame.

### Thoughts about the bottcamp
I have really enjoyed the experience so far, sometimes is hard because I keep having a hard time with scripts and C#, so sometimes I need to search a lot of tutorials so I can do something to move the player, include the animations, detect the collisions, but I really appreciate the project model of the bootcamp, since doing something real always helps when it comes to learn. 

#### About the Game
The main character is a cat that is running away from something in a big city or maybe even running in this city trying to find something or someone. This cat has to catch cans of tuna in order to improve their score and avoid cucumbers that can kill him and trash cans that can get him off the city. 

##### Unity Version
The game was created in the Unity Editor Version 2021.3.19.f1.
